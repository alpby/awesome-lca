A curated list of awesome LCA resources. Inspired by [awesome-php](https://github.com/ziadoz/awesome-php) and [awesome-computer-vision](https://github.com/jbhuang0604/awesome-computer-vision). 

LCA is a methodology to assess environmental impacts associated with all the stages of a product's life, from raw material extraction, production, use, and disposal. This repository aims to help researchers, practitioners, and enthusiasts find valuable LCA resources in one place.
